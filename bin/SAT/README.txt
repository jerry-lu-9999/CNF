Hi there whatsupppp

This project is made of three parts, so is our project 

In the main method, you will find that I called part1, part2, and part3. Their methods implementation is also in the main class, but will then use other class like CNF.

Because of the requirement for "informative messages", I have kept all the relevant println statements to prove that I'm not just giving you the answer. However, if you just want to check whether I got everything correct, then go to KnowledgeBase.java, and comment out Line 107. Then you would get a clean result. Thank you for your understanding!


For part 3, things are tricky. By default I will test nqueen4 and the short given one. For the optional 2 cnf.txt file, I would require you to give me the file in the command line so I can run it. It does not guarantee that it will generate the satisfiability assignment for the first time, so maybe you can try again or adjust the parameter in my code. Regardless, from my testing, I have generated the following satisfiability assignment to prove that my algorithm works.

For Quinn.cnf, I have

T F T F T T T T T F F T T F F T

For nqueens4, I have

F F T F T F F F F F F T F T F F

I have also tried multiple times to get the result. I don't want to turn off the tracing because it feels more techie when it is generating logs. 

Happy Testing!!
